# Sponsor Messaging Feature Request

## Overview
Implement a sponsor messaging system that allows administrators to configure sponsor users who can automatically send welcome/promotional messages to new users or all users in the system.

## User Stories

### As an Administrator
- **Story 1**: I want to create sponsor configurations so that specific users can act as sponsors for onboarding new users
- **Story 2**: I want to deactivate sponsor configurations so that I can disable sponsors who are no longer active (while preserving audit trail)
- **Story 3**: I want to reactivate existing sponsors with updated settings so that I can re-enable previous sponsors with new messages
- **Story 4**: I want to configure sponsor message filtering (everyone vs new users only) so that I can control who receives sponsor messages
- **Story 5**: I want to view all active sponsors so that I can manage the sponsor system effectively

### As a New User
- **Story 5**: When I register for ChatFlow, I should automatically receive welcome messages from configured sponsors to help me get started
- **Story 6**: I should be able to respond to sponsor messages just like any other conversation

### As a Sponsor User
- **Story 7**: When I'm configured as a sponsor, my messages should be automatically sent to target users based on the filter configuration
- **Story 8**: I should be able to have normal conversations with users who received my sponsor messages

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Sponsor Collection Management**
   - Create new sponsor configurations
   - Reactivate existing inactive sponsor configurations with updated settings
   - Deactivate sponsor configurations (soft delete for audit trail)
   - Store sponsor user email, message content, target filter, and active status

2. **Target Filtering**
   - Support "new_user" filter: Send messages only to newly registered users
   - Support "everyone" filter: Send messages to all existing and new users

3. **Automatic Message Delivery**
   - Create direct conversations between sponsor and target users
   - Send sponsor messages automatically when conditions are met
   - Handle message delivery for "everyone" filter when sponsor is added

4. **Admin-Only Access**
   - Restrict sponsor management to admin users only
   - Proper authorization and validation

### Behavioral Requirements
1. **New User Registration Flow**
   - When a user registers, check for active sponsors with "new_user" or "everyone" filters
   - Create direct conversations between new user and each matching sponsor
   - Send sponsor messages in each conversation

2. **Everyone Filter Activation**
   - When a sponsor with "everyone" filter is created, send messages to all existing users
   - Create conversations with users who don't already have one with the sponsor
   - Skip users who already have conversations with the sponsor

3. **Conversation Management**
   - Reuse existing direct conversations between sponsor and user
   - Follow normal conversation creation patterns
   - Maintain conversation history and participant management

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
- New `sponsors` collection with proper indexing
- Integration with existing `users` and `conversations` collections
- Proper data validation and constraints

### API Endpoints
- `POST /v1/admin/sponsors` - Create new sponsor or reactivate existing inactive sponsor
- `DELETE /v1/admin/sponsors/:sponsorId` - Deactivate sponsor (soft delete)
- `GET /v1/admin/sponsors` - List all active sponsors (with option to include inactive)
- All endpoints require admin authentication

### Security
- Admin-only access to all sponsor endpoints
- Input validation for all sponsor data
- Rate limiting on sponsor endpoints
- Audit logging for sponsor operations

### Performance
- Efficient batch processing for "everyone" filter
- Async message delivery to avoid blocking
- Proper error handling and retry logic

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability
- Handle large numbers of users for "everyone" filter
- Batch processing with reasonable memory usage
- Database query optimization

### Reliability
- Transaction consistency for sponsor operations
- Graceful handling of failed message deliveries
- Proper error logging and monitoring

### Maintainability
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. Sponsors can be successfully created and removed by admins
2. New users automatically receive sponsor messages upon registration
3. "Everyone" filter correctly sends messages to all existing users
4. All sponsor messages create proper direct conversations
5. Zero data corruption or inconsistency issues

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. Sponsor operations complete within acceptable time limits (< 5 seconds for single user, < 30 seconds for "everyone")
2. System handles edge cases gracefully (duplicate sponsors, non-existent users, etc.)
3. Comprehensive audit trail for all sponsor operations
4. Performance remains stable under normal load

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring sponsor message delivery doesn't corrupt existing conversations
- **Performance Impact**: "Everyone" filter could impact system performance with large user bases
- **Spam Prevention**: Preventing abuse of sponsor system for spam

### Medium Risk
- **Edge Cases**: Handling deleted users, deactivated sponsors, etc.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring system scales with growing user base
- **User Experience**: Avoiding overwhelming new users with too many sponsor messages

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use database transactions for all sponsor operations
2. Implement batch processing with size limits
3. Add rate limiting and monitoring for sponsor activity
4. Comprehensive testing including edge cases
5. Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Admin can create sponsor with email, message, and filter type
- [ ] Admin can reactivate existing inactive sponsor with updated settings
- [ ] Admin can deactivate sponsor by ID (soft delete, preserves audit trail)
- [ ] Admin can list all active sponsors
- [ ] System prevents duplicate active sponsors for same user
- [ ] New user registration triggers sponsor messages for matching active sponsors
- [ ] "Everyone" filter sends messages to all existing users when sponsor is created/reactivated
- [ ] Direct conversations are created/reused properly
- [ ] All operations are admin-only and properly authenticated
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Should Have
- [ ] Batch processing for "everyone" filter with progress tracking
- [ ] Option to view inactive sponsors in admin interface
- [ ] Audit trail showing all sponsor state changes (create/reactivate/deactivate)
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Validation to prevent admin users from being sponsors

### Could Have
- [ ] Sponsor message templates with variables
- [ ] Scheduling for sponsor message delivery
- [ ] Analytics on sponsor message effectiveness
- [ ] User opt-out mechanism for sponsor messages

## Dependencies
- Existing user registration system
- Conversation service
- Message service
- Admin authentication system
- Database transaction support

## Timeline Estimate
- **Design & Planning**: 1-2 days
- **Implementation**: 3-5 days
- **Testing**: 2-3 days
- **Documentation**: 1 day
- **Total**: 7-11 days

## Open Questions
1. Should there be a limit on the number of active sponsors?
2. How should we handle sponsor users who are deleted/deactivated from the system?
3. Should sponsor messages have special indicators in the UI?
4. What happens if a sponsor message delivery fails during reactivation?
5. Should we support multiple messages per sponsor or version history?
6. How do we prevent sponsor message spam during reactivation?
7. Should reactivation always trigger "everyone" messages again, or only for new users since deactivation?
